# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The aim of a customer churn prediction project is to develop machine learning models that can effectively identify customers who are likely to discontinue using a product or service. 
  ### Two popular algorithms
  Two popular algorithms used in this project are decision tree classifiers and random forest. 
  #### Decision tree classifiers
  Decision tree classifiers use a top-down approach that recursively splits data based on the input features, enabling the prediction of the outcome from the final leaf node.
  #### Random forest
  Random forest, on the other hand, builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to enhance accuracy. By analyzing large customer datasets that contain information such as demographics, usage behavior, and customer service interactions, both techniques can extract insights and patterns to predict customer churn.
  ### Output
  The output of this project is a model that businesses can use to forecast which customers are at risk of churning, enabling proactive engagement to prevent churn and improve customer retention.
